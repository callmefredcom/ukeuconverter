# uk-eu converter

This was one of the first web apps I developed in my personal coding journey.

It's a simple imperial - metric converter.
<br>It's coded in pure HTML, CSS and JS,<br>with some Flask for the basic routing.
<br><br>
The <b>.dockerignore</b> and <b>Dockerfile</b> files were used to deploy the app to Google Cloud Run.
<br><br>Feel free to clone it and play with it.
